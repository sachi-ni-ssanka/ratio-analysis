Profitability ratio is the measure of company's ability to deliver profit. Here is how we can calculate.

Return on capital employed (ROCE) = operating profit / (non-current liabilities +total equity)

Return on sales (ROS) = operating profit / revenue %		

Gross margin = gross profit/ revenue %		

Current ratio = current assets / current liabilities						

Quick ratio= (current assets – inventory) / current liabilities						

Asset turnover = revenue / (non-current liabilities + total equity)						

Receivables days = receivables / credit sales × 365 days						

Inventory days = inventory / cost of sales × 365 days						

Payable days = payables / purchases (or cost of sales) × 365 days						

Debt-to-equity = non-current liabilities / ordinary shareholders funds %						

Interest cover = operating profit / finance costs
